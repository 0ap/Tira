Doing set-operations (OR,XOR,AND) on two textfiles containing whole numbers. Set operations are done by using hashtables.
To run the program - place two text files in the root directory named 'setA.txt' and 'setB.txt'. The textfiles should contain only whole numbers, each number followed by a line break. The program will output 3 new textfiles in the same directory, containg the output of set operations on these two files.
